When I found this challenge, I thought this is interesting !!!!!

Since graduating from college last year,  I have rarely coding after finishing my all-day work. ( I'm worn out ... just lazy and open the Netflix .. )

After Founding this challenge, I thought this plan can help me to push myself. So I listed the goals that I want to achieve In this 100 days :


:content-section-title{title="GOALS!"}

- Side Project → I want to prepare my portfolios, and practice my TS skill. ( or play something interesting. )
  - In this section, my main goal is do the side project with TS  .
  - Use the css to draw something cool and fun.
- Play some tools or new things in frontend ecosystem.
- Data Structure / Algorithm ( TypeScript ) → review the concept and **implement.**
- Design Pattern  ( TypeScript )  → review the concept and **implement.**


Haha … I can't image if it will go well, maybe I will make some adjustments if it's too busy or some unexpected things happen. BTW I wish I will learn something good.
